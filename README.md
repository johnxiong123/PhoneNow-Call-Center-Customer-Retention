# PhoneNow-Call-Center-Customer-Retention

### INTRODUCTION
A few weeks after presenting the Customer Satisfaction and Agent Behavior dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reached out to me directly. She was impressed by the work and asked if I can put together a dashboard about customer retention.
This is the second task in the Virtual case experience with PwC. I’ll be reporting to the retention manager of PwC about customer retention in PhoneNow.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
The Retention department in the telecom company, PhoneNow, is concerned about losing their customers and also getting back churned customers. The customers are of priority to them as customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned.
The project was done based on the request of the Retention Manager. The engagement partner, requested for the following tasks to be done
Define proper KPI
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPI
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining my findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed.

### Insights:
The Churn Dashboard reveals that a significant number of customers at risk are those with tech support tickets and those on month-to-month contracts.

The Customer Risk Analysis indicates that the churn rate is notably higher among customers with DSL internet service and those with higher monthly charges.

### Suggestions:

Proactive Engagement: Implement predictive analytics to identify customers at risk of churn before contract termination, focusing particularly on those with frequent tech support interactions and those on short-term contracts.

Service Enhancement: Boost Fiber Optic support and evaluate the tech support ticket resolution process to increase customer satisfaction and retention.

Contract Incentives: Develop incentives for month-to-month customers to transition to longer-term contracts.

Pricing Strategy: Review and adjust the pricing model for high-risk segments to offer competitive rates that could reduce the churn rate.
